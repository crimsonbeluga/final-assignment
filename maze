            <h4>Game Designer</h4>
            <p>Game designers create the foundation of a game, including the gameplay, rules, systems, and world-building.
                They use their creativity, understanding of player psychology, and game mechanics to create engaging and
                immersive experiences.</p>

            <h4>Degree Objective(s) Met</h4>
            <p><strong>Degree Objective Two:</strong> Demonstrate effective game design practices and techniques within
                the project scope and context, such as genre, style, platform, and audience.</p>
            <p><strong>Degree Objective Six:</strong> Establish collaboration, mentorship, and professional leadership
                skills by working with other disciplines to deliver highly polished and completed projects.</p>

            <h4>Explanation of Assignment</h4>
            <p>You are to create a concept for a simple game. Your engine for this exercise is a ball or ball-like
                structure (a wadded up piece of paper would work). Your challenge is to create a game using the ball that
                does not involve throwing, kicking, or flicking the ball in any way. The game should be competitive and
                involve two players or two teams.</p>

            <p>The following constraints must be considered and adhered to when creating your game:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Must involve a ball.</li>
                <li>Must be physically playable (no video games or physics-defying ideas).</li>
                <li>The ball can't be kicked, thrown, shot, or flicked.</li>
                <li>The game is a competitive game between two players.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a rule sheet that would allow someone to play the game without external information from you, the
                    designer.</li>
                <li>Playtest the game to test for bugs, engagement, and fun.</li>
                <li>Take pictures of the game in action, sketch up ideas, or use any images that help better explain your game.</li>
                <li>Include a short write-up that defines the theme or reason the play is taking place and identifies what it is about
                    the game that is fun.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Be prepared to present these ideas to the class, and the team with the best game design will earn extra credit.
                The instructor will select a winner.</p>
