        </h4>
        <p3> In this project we had to create a game using only dice and chips that would be fun, balanced and strategic.

            The idea i came up with was to create a game using the dice numbers on the chips, placing them next to each other as shown would tally up a number count with the goal being to hit a certain number. Going over this number would count as a loss and the winner would be determined by who was closest to the goal number.
